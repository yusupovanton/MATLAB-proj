# descendMatlab
Coordinate descend metod implemented in MatLab
All of the presented code files were developed by me on my co-op during summer of 2018. This particular project's task was to visualize a method of minimization of a non-algebraicly defined function. 
The resultant plane and the markers are a result of condecutively descending in the direction against the gradient of the given function. Initial points were chosen randomly, therefore method works for any initial condition. 
Later on I modified the code to work in 7-dimensional space, as there is 6 independent parameters we need to find in order to minimize the vibrations of a real metalworking station's drill. Unfortunately, my supervisors asked me to not publish any of it.
