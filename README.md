# simplexMatlab
An implementation of simplex method in Matlab
Similarly, this is one of my projects during my 2018 co-op. Since you only need three points to evaluate the antigradient direction of the function, the simplex method is a faster version of the consecutive coordinate descend method. By using the geometric concepts of stretching and mirroring points in space, we can see the visualization of the simplex method as it approximates the minimum of our non-algebraic function.
